# rosbot TODO

## Bugs

- [ ] **Voice input disabled** — `faster-whisper` fails to install in `Dockerfile.rosbot`.
      `docker exec rosbot-rosbot-1 pip list | grep whisper` returns nothing.
      Fix the pip install or switch to `openai-whisper` as fallback.

- [ ] **Robot spawns facing -x** — TurtleBot4 spawns with its forward axis pointing
      in the -x world direction. Not a functional bug (relative navigation works correctly)
      but confusing when checking `sim_ground_truth_pose`. Add a `yaw` spawn arg to
      `headless_sim.launch.py` → `turtlebot4_spawn.launch.py` to spawn facing +x.

- [ ] **`get_position` tool unverified** — `/odom` had 0 publishers for most of the
      debugging session. Confirm it has a publisher now that diffdrive is active, and
      test that "where am I?" returns correct coordinates.

- [ ] **Low RTF (real-time factor)** — robot undershoots distance commands (~0.12m
      instead of 1m). Verify the NVIDIA EGL path is actually active (check logs for
      "NVIDIA GPU detected") vs Mesa software fallback. If EGL is active, RTF should
      be near 1.0 and distance accuracy should improve significantly.

- [ ] **diffdrive_controller spawner race** — TB4's own spawner (spawner-46) still
      fails with "already loaded" on every boot. Our spawner-70 recovers it, but the
      error is noisy. Investigate whether removing the TB4 spawner from the spawn
      launch args is possible, or suppress the error cleanly.

- [ ] **Clock bridge topic hardcoded** — `headless_sim.launch.py` reads `TB4_WORLD`
      env var to construct the clock topic `/world/depot/clock`. If world changes,
      the bridge topic must match. Make this fully dynamic from the `world` launch arg.

## Improvements

- [ ] **Distance accuracy** — `drive()` uses fixed velocity × duration to estimate
      distance. At low RTF this is way off. Use `/odom` feedback to drive a measured
      distance instead of timed velocity.

- [ ] **`get_position` should use sim_ground_truth_pose in sim mode** — `/odom` drifts;
      `/sim_ground_truth_pose` is exact. Auto-detect sim vs real and pick the right topic.

- [ ] **Spawn orientation** — Add `x`, `y`, `yaw` launch args to `headless_sim.launch.py`
      so spawn pose is configurable without editing source.

- [ ] **`.env.example` GPU section** — Add commented-out examples for `SIM_GPU` and
      `VLLM_GPUS` with instructions for finding UUIDs via `nvidia-smi -L`.

- [ ] **`rosbot.sh gui` command** — Currently just prints the gz sim -g connect command.
      Should also check if gz is installed locally and warn if not.

- [ ] **Health check in docker-compose** — Add a healthcheck to the sim service so
      rosbot container waits for rosbridge to be ready instead of relying on timing.

- [ ] **Ogre1 rename is permanent** — `sim_entrypoint.sh` renames `libgz-rendering-ogre.so`
      to `.bak` inside the container. This persists across restarts (same container).
      Fine for now but if the image is rebuilt the rename is lost — document this or
      move the rename into the Dockerfile build step instead.

## Real Robot

- [ ] **Test with real TurtleBot4** — Change `ROSBRIDGE_URL=ws://turtlebot4.local:9090`
      and `TWIST_STAMPED=true` in `.env`, run `./rosbot.sh real`. Verify drive/stop/
      get_position/get_battery all work on hardware.

- [ ] **Real robot: `/cmd_vel` type** — Confirm whether the real TB4 expects `Twist`
      or `TwistStamped`. May differ between firmware versions.

## Nice to Have

- [ ] **Nav2 integration** — Add a `navigate_to(x, y)` tool that sends a goal to
      Nav2 action server instead of raw velocity commands.

- [ ] **Map tool** — `get_map()` tool that returns a base64 occupancy grid image
      from `/map` topic for display in the web UI.

- [ ] **Multi-robot** — Namespace support is already in the launch file. Wire it
      through docker-compose so multiple robots can be controlled from one server.
